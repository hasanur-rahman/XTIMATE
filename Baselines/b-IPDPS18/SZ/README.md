I retrieved the archive and found the code base with SZ source code tags as well as the executables that have already been built with the tag info.

I was trying to search the git diff patch, but without luck because the code was archived with a single commit. The code change was based on SZ 1.4. You should be able to get useful tag information by running the existing SZ/example/testdouble_compress executable with any data you input. Based on the output message, you should be able to locate the tags I added.
